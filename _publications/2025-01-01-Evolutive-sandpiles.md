The Abelian sandpile model was the first example of a self-organized critical system studied by Bak, Tang and Wiesenfeld. The dynamics of the sandpiles occur when the grains topple over a graph. In this study, we allow the graph to evolve over time and change its topology at each stage. This turns out in the occurrence of phenomena impossible in the classical sandpile models. For instance, unstable configurations over evolutive graphs with a sink that never stabilize. We also experiment with the stabilization of configurations with a large number of grains at the center over evolutive graphs, this allows us to obtain interesting fractals. Finally, we obtain power laws associated with some evolutive sandpiles.
