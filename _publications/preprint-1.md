It is well known that the spectrum and the Smith normal form of a matrix can be computed in polynomial time. Thus, it is interesting to explore how good are these parameters for distinguishing graphs. This is relevant since it is related to the Graph Isomorphism Problem (GIP), which asks to determine whether two graphs are isomorphic. In this paper, we explore the computational advantages of using the spectrum and the Smith normal form of two matrices associated with a graph. By considering the SNF or the spectrum of two matrices of a graph as a single parameter, we compute the number of non-isomorphic graphs with the same parameter with up to 9 vertices, and with up to 10 vertices when the number of graphs with 9 vertices with the same parameter is less than 1000. Focusing on the best 20 combinations of matrices for graphs with 10 vertices, we notice that the number of such graphs with a mate is less than 100 in any of these 20 cases. This computational result improves on similar previous explorations. Therefore, the use of the spectrum or the SNF of two matrices at the same time shows a substantial improvement in distinguishing graphs.
