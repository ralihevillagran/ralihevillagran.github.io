Let \\(\mathcal{K}_k\\) be the family of connected graphs G whose sandpile groups have minimal number of generators equal to \\( \| G \|-k-1\\), where \\( \| G \| \\) is the number of vertices of \\(G\\). We survey previous result on the characterization of \\(\mathcal{K}_1\\) and \\(\mathcal{K}_2\\), including complete characterizations for both cases. Furthermore, we shed some light on the characterization of \\(\mathcal{K}_3\\). Particularly, we give a minimal list of graphs that are forbidden for the regular graphs in \\(\mathcal{K}_3\\) and we use them to give a characterization of the regular graphs in \\(\mathcal{K}_3\\).
